Let's analyze the `beer_mkts` data:

```{r}
beer_mkts <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
```

## Variable Description for `Beer_Markets` data.frame

The following describes the variables in the `Beer_Markets` data.frame.


* `hh`: an identifier of the household;
* `X_purchase_desc`: details on the purchased item;
* `quantity`: the number of items purchased;
* `brand`: Bud Light, Busch Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, or Natural Light;
* `dollar_spent`: total dollar value of purchase;
* `beer_floz`: total volume of beer, in fluid ounces;
* `price_per_floz`: price per fl.oz. (i.e., beer spent/beer floz);
* `container`: the type of container;
* `promo`: Whether the item was promoted (coupon or otherwise);
* `market`: Scan-track market (or state if rural);
demographic data, including gender, marital status, household income, class of work, race, education, age, the size of household, and whether or not the household has a microwave or a dishwasher.


## Q2a.
* Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz.

* Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of COORS LIGHT.
* Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of MILLER LITE.
* Find the top 5 markets in terms of the total beer_floz of NATURAL LIGHT.
