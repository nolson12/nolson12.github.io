Let's analyze the `restaurant` data:

```{r}
restaurant <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv")
```


```{r}
#| results: asis
rmarkdown::paged_table(restaurant) 
```

## Q1c.
* Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the distribution of SCORE varies by GRADE and CRITICAL FLAG.

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = SCORE, y = GRADE, fill = GRADE) ) +
  facet_grid( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ . )
```

  + Histograms
```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_grid( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ GRADE )
```

  + Histograms with varying x- and y- scales across facets
```{r}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_wrap( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ GRADE, scales = 'free' )
